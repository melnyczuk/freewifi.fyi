        <h1>Welcome to Ratio Club!</h1>

        <p>Ratio Club computer coding workshops for artists start in November 2017!</p>

        <p>
            We are delighted to announce Ratio Club: a ten-week workshop program, based in Bunbury WA, which explores computation as a tool for creative practice.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is an opportunity for artists and others with an interest in new media art to learn to write code and explore your practice in collaboration with other like-minded peers.
        </p>
        <h3>
            HOW DOES IT WORK?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Ratio Club is a ten-week workshop program exploring computation as creative practice. Participants will take part in a series of facilitated sessions blending practical tutorial and critical discussion.
        </p>
        <p>
            The workshops are structured to introduce novice coders to basic programming concepts, algorithmic approaches to digital design and modelling, and strategies for employing these in artistic practice.
        </p>
        <p>
            They are therefore targeted towards creative practitioners who have limited prior coding experience, but who may have a broad array of other technical skills and experience.
        </p>
        <h3>
            WHO SHOULD APPLY?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Ratio Club is open to practitioners from any background, who are curious and eager to experiment. You do not need to have any prior technical experience, but you should own your own computer, and be familiar with how it works. Participants must commit
            to all ten workshop sessions.
        </p>
        <h3>
            WHAT DOES IT COST?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Participation in Ratio Club is free. There is a single bursary available which provides a grant of a laptop computer. This bursary is available to anyone who identifies as a member of a group who traditionally lacks access to computational technology
            (whether due to race, gender, sexuality, geography or class). Please indicate on your application if you would like to be considered for this bursary.
        </p>
        <h3>
