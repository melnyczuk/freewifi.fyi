    "description": "10PRINT explores the relationship between labour and identity in a computer-driven world. This artwork laboriously executes by hand a program consisting of a single line of code, created in the computer language BASIC in the 1980s. Through replicating this random, infinite pattern with hand-embroidery, this work questions the value of labour performed by both humans and machines. It asks whether some part of our humanity may be lost when we command computers and machines to complete the mundane everyday which forms the bedrock of our existence, and whether increased efficiency and productivity is a worthy trade for this loss.",
